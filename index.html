    <h2>About Jules and Elko</h2>
    <p>
        This is my spunky cat, Julien on the right and my partner's fluffy cat, Elko on the left. 
        Julien has a brother named, Maurice, who looks almost identical to him, but was recently rehomed with a friend of mine.
        These two have been enjoying eachother's company ever since then.

    <h2>Why they are my favorite</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>They are total goofballs and are a ton of fun to be around</li>
        <li>They are total chillers and love to lay with me on the couch</li>
        <li>And they teach me to be a cool cat just like them</li>
    </ul>
